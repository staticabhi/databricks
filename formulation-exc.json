"Overall rationale for the current Amendment:
This global amendment revised the definition of the Microbiological ITT (micro-ITT)
population to align with the reporting and analysis plan; reference to EUCAST
breakpoints was deleted from this population definition in accordance with regulatory
agency feedback.
The amendment includes wording edits based on the above changes.
Minor editorial edits have been done.
Reference list has been updated as one reference
was erroneously missed.
Reference list for erroneously
missed reference has been
updated
Revisions were made to support
the planned efficacy analyses
per the reporting and analysis
plan.
Reference list has been updated

SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: A Phase III, Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label Study in Adolescent
and Adult Participants Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Gepotidacin
to Ceftriaxone
Plus Azithromycin in the Treatment of Uncomplicated Urogenital Gonorrhea Caused by
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
Short Title: Phase III, Comparator-Controlled, Efficacy and Safety
Study of
Gepotidacin in the Treatment of Uncomplicated Urogenital Gonorrhea; Efficacy of
Antibacterial Gepotidacin Evaluated (EAGLE-1)
Rationale:
Gonorrhea is the second most prevalent bacterial",
"Overall rationale for the current Amendment:
This global amendment increased the total enrollment sample size; revised and added key
populations for analyses to support the planned efficacy analyses per the current reporting
and analysis plan; and removed the covariate age at Baseline from the primary efficacy
analyses.
The amendment includes minor updates to gepotidacin introductory and risk
text for consistency with the current investigator’s brochure, and revised
crediblemeds.org instructions for consistency with the current website.
The amendment
also includes minor administrative and wording edits and editorial text additions per the
current protocol template.
The key populations for analyses
have been updated and added.
Excluded the covariate “Age at
Baseline” from the primary
efficacy analyses.
Of note, there is
no change to the randomization
stratification.
Based on the microbiological
evaluability rate, the total sample
size was increased to ensure the
number of participants in the
micro-ITT Population was
reached.
Revisions were made to support
the planned efficacy analyses
per the current reporting and
analysis plan.
Based on current enrollment
projections, there will be an
insufficient number of
participants in the <18 and
>65 years age categories in
each treatment group at the end
of the study; thus, the sample
size in those categories will not
be sufficient to support the
primary analysis.
Section 3 Introduction Updated gepotidacin text based
on the investigator’s brochure.
Revised for consistency with the
investigator’s brochure.",
"Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
This global amendment revised the primary analysis to be performed using the Miettinen
and Nurminen method instead
of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method; added estimand

text; indicated study operational allowances with regard to COVID-19; incorporated past
administrative and site notification letters;
provided minor clarifications to the
microbiology and NAAT defining criteria in the response and outcomes tables; indicated
the total enrollment population will
be approximately 600 participants; added micro-ITT
subpopulations for participants with NG isolated in their rectal/pharyngeal specimen; and
incorporated updates per the most
recent safety and PK data known for gepotidacin,
which included removal of P-glycoprotein inducers from the prohibited medications.
Minor clarifications were also made throughout the protocol including, but not limited to,
the Schedule of Activities table, inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary and secondary
objectives, randomization stratification text, and adverse events of special interest.
The
amendment also includes additional minor administrative and wording edits.
To avoid
confusion, the term “sex” will be
used from this point forward.
Thus,
when NAAT samples are
submitted for NG testing, they
are also routinely tested for CT
and results are reported for both
pathogens.
