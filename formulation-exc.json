=-------------------------=

Overall rationale for the current Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to
i) include the assessment of the efficacy of
annual revaccinations with the RSVPreF3 OA
investigational vaccine, in addition to the assessment of efficacy over 3 seasons after a
single dose
vaccination, and ii) add the evaluation of efficacy against each RSV subtype
independently as secondary confirmatory objective at the end of
the study, conditional to
the number of cases accrued.
Moreover, the evaluation of efficacy against human
metapneumovirus (hMPV) will be upgraded to a secondary confirmatory objective.
Minor editorial changes for consistency and clarity have also been made and
typographical errors have been corrected.
