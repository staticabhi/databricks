"Overall Rationale for the Amendment 04
Amendment 04 is a global protocol amendment intended to allow better study accessibility to
patients and to ensure good enrollment rate by lifting the requirement to completely fill 3 TPS
stratification cohorts.
Per protocol, patients are stratified into 3 TPS cohorts <1%, 1-49% and
>50% PD-L1 expression.
This stratification will stay in place, but following amendment
version 04, the number of participants per cohort will no longer be limited to 80.
Participant’s
safety and treatment efficacy is not impacted, nor will this change affect the study readout.
Additional minor updates to the management of immunotherapy related AEs were done to align
with dostarlimab program.
Editorial and typographic changes and protocol clarifications were also made with this
amendment.
A description and rationale for changes is provided in Table 2.",
"Overall Rationale for the Amendment
Amendment 1 DEU-1 is a country-specific protocol amendment created in response to Health
Authority feedback to clarify the instructions in the sections of the protocol as specified below.
Additionally, the protocol was updated to correct instructional statements regarding the
administration of cisplatin in the study.
A description and rationale for all changes is provided in
Table 26.
Other minor editorial changes were also made in this amendment.",
"Amendment 2 (10 September 2020)
Overall Rationale for the Amendment
Amendment 02 is a global protocol amendment created in response to Health Authority feedback
to modify the contraception eligibility criterion and the chemotherapy study treatments section to
ensure that the protocol instructions take local labeling variability into account regarding
chemotherapeutic agents.
Other minor editorial and typographic changes were also made with
this amendment.
A description and rationale for all changes is provided in Table 28.",
"Overall Rationale for the Amendment
Amendment 03 is a global protocol amendment intended to provide a number of clarifications to

In addition, the Germany specific amendment was incorporated

"Summary of Protocol Amendments
There were two global amendments, 12 country-specific, and one administrative to the original
protocol (dated Jun 27, 2019).
Protocol Amendment 1 (Global)
Amendment 1 was implemented August 16, 2019.
The main changes to the protocol included the
following:
 Clarified criteria for dose reduction due to thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and
nonhematologic or other toxicities, and subsequent dose re-escalation.
 Modified thresholds for platelet count recovery required to resume treatment based on
baseline value.
 Updated procedures for managing transition from randomized treatment to open-label
treatment so treatment assignment would only be unblinded when required to determine
eligibility for open-label treatment with MMB or DAN.
Protocol Amendment 2 (Global)
Amendment 2 was implemented December 18, 2020.
The main changes to the protocol included
the following:
 Removed interim analysis for sample size reassessment from the study design.

NDA 216873
Momelotinib (MMB)/OJJAARA
 Modified the planned statistical analysis by moving the MMRM analysis of the MFSAF TSS
secondary endpoint to the fourth position in the overall statistical testing hierarchy and
revised description of hierarchal statistical testing of secondary endpoint.
 Changed timing of first dose after randomization, JAK inhibitor nontreatment period,
exclusion of active anti-MF medication, and baseline spleen volume assessment to allow
flexibility for scheduling randomization and day 1.
 Revised and clarified some inclusion and exclusion criteria.
 Added a protocol addendum for guidance on modified study procedures that could be
followed during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
"Summary of Protocol Amendments, SIMPLIFY1
There
were three global amendments, and three country-specific amendments (two for Japan
only and one for South Korea only) to the original protocol (dated June 26, 2013).
Amendment 1 (Global)
Amendment 1 was implemented December 13, 2013.
The main changes to the protocol included
updating study objectives per regulatory agency guidance, eligibility criteria based on newly
available nonclinical data, study assessments based on evolving data for MF and JAK inhibitors
and requirements for radiology review.
Updated IWG-MRT/ELN assessments to reflect June
2013 guidelines and not to require bone marrow aspirate/biopsy if performed within 90 days
prior to the first dose of study drug.
Amendment 1.1 (Global)
Amendment 1.1 was implemented February 12, 2014.
The main changes to the protocol included
updated exclusion criteria to include the use of dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and
updated dose increase instructions for insufficient efficacy of study drug.
Amendment 1.2 (Japan Only)
Amendment 1.2 was implemented on May 19, 2014, to include data and safety review for Japan.
Amendment 2 (Global)
Amendment 2 was implemented on July 18, 2014.
The main changes to the protocol included:
 Added ophthalmic examinations to assess for cataracts and visual acuity based on MMB
investigator’s
brochure, version 7
 Clarified methods for managing missing data in the primary analysis
 Updated language regarding concomitant medications based on
newly available drugdrug
interaction data
 Removal of exploratory endpoints of progression free survival and response rates for
ANC and platelets, as well",
"Summary of Protocol Amendments, SIMPLIFY2
There
were two amendments to the original protocol (dated December 20, 2013).
Amendment 1
Amendment 1 was implemented July 18, 2014.
The main changes to the protocol included
clarification of methods for managing missing data in the primary analysis, addition of
ophthalmic examination and clarification regarding the coadministration of CYP3A
inhibitors/inducers, breast cancer resistance protein substrates, and organic anion-transporting
polypeptide inhibitors.
Amendment 2
Amendment 2 was implemented July 20, 2017.
The main changes to the protocol included
protocol study visits were extended to allow continued treatment with MMB through Week 204
and to update MMB formulation to allow for contingency to use plain-faced or debossed, round
or triangle-shaped tablet presentation, should the clinical drug supply be depleted or expire prior
to the end of the study.

Subgroup Analyses for the Primary
Endpoint, MOMENTUM
Subgroup analyses were conducted for MOMENTUM to assess the potential for differences in
the treatment effect for various demographic and clinical characteristics groups (Figure 67).
Overall, the treatment effect of MMB compared to DAN appeared consistent across baseline
demographics and disease characteristics subgroups.
However, these subgroup analyses were
limited by the small numbers of patients, and so the results should be interpreted with caution.
Of
note, in subgroups based on geographic region, no responders were reported for the 29 subjects
in North America (0 of 17 subjects MMB, 0 of 12 subjects DAN), which leads to the potential
issue on the applicability of the efficacy results to the US population.
Further discussion
regarding this issue can be found in Section 6.3.1."
